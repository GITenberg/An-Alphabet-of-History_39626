<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alexander the Great was a victim of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he sighed there was naught to delight him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he brandished his sword and defiantly roared<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And could not get a country to fight him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All the armies he'd chased, all the lands laid to waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he clamored for further diversions;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our history speaks of his grip on the Greeks<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And his hammerlock hold on the Persians.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though the Gordian knot, cut in two, in a spot<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In his palace was labeled a relic,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Bucephalus, stuffed, gave him fame, he was &nbsp;&nbsp;huffed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He was grouchy and grumpy, was Aleck.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the cause of his woe, he would have you to know,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was the fact that he never was able<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To conduct a big scrap that a versatile chap<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of a war correspondent would cable.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Stead of being quite glad, he would grow very sad<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When he told of the fellows who'd fought him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he thought of the lack of the clicking kodak<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In the hands of a man to "snapshot" him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We are told that he wept, and in dolefulness crept<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Through his palace&mdash;the reason is hinted:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were not at that time magazines for a dime,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And his articles could not be printed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though it may seem unkind, ere his life we've outlined,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We must say in some ways he was hateful;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in truth, we have heard he went back on his word,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And was not Alexander the Grateful.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">He said they should have stretched it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And we are told that Jule was cold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And frigid as Alaska,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambitious, too,&mdash;that would not do<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For Cassius and Casca.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They told their friends: "It all depends<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Let us conspire with Brutus."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With dirk and sword in togas stored&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You know those times they wore 'em&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They made a muss of Ju-li-us<br /></span>
<span class="i2">One morning in the Forum.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With "Et tu, Brute?" J. C. grew mute.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mark Antony arose, and he<br /></span>

<span class="i2">As when Bill Shakespeare wrote it.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When Christopher Columbus stood the egg upon its end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He solved a weighty problem that no one could comprehend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps it was the puzzle whose solution clearly showed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The psychologic motives of the hen that crossed the road.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps cold storage minstrels never might have heard of this<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If it hadn't been for Chris.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Columbus packed his little grip and got upon the train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went to see that noble man, King Ferdinand of Spain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Result: He found America&mdash;oh, do not idly nod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if it hadn't been for this we couldn't go abroad!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just think of all the travel and the voyages we'd miss<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If it hadn't been for Chris.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Columbus found America and won a lot of fame&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nobody ever thought to ask him how he knew its name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nobody ever booked him for some lectures to declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In eloquent assertions how he knew the land was there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Today we might be savages, unknowing modern bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If it hadn't been for Chris.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He landed near Havana, and he said: "It seems to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sometime in the future little Cuby shall be free."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His vision was prophetic&mdash;far adown the future's track<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the dauntless Hobson and the sinking Merrimac.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We might have still been tyros in the ethics of the kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i4">If it hadn't been for Chris.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Today there are big cities and big buildings named for him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet he was so poor that once he thought he'd have to swim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find this wondrous country, for he was so badly broke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Isabella nobly put her watch and ring in soak.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This world was but a fleeting show&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He knew a lot about it;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">He then began to doubt it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seldom left his narrow home&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not even on a Sunday;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only time that he would roam<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Abroad was on a Monday.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For that, you know, is washing day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Society, with all its sham,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gave him a paroxysm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He always spoke in epigram<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One day he took his lantern down<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And polished it and lit it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first he frowned a peevish frown<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And growled: "The wick don't fit it."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, with pessimistic scan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought to find an honest man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Diogenes has long been dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His search was not well heeded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For no historian has said<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If ever he succeeded.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there's this thought for you and me:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It would not be quite pleasant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If on that quest the sage should be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With his fierce light, at present.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, if he were, one may but think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much that light would make him blink.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">No matter how much they write&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It's really hard to say just which,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But he was full of promise.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hippocrates was father to an awful lot of bother, for 'tis claimed that as to medicine he was the pioneer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That but for him the surgeon or the latter-day chirurgeon might never have been tinkering the human running gear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hippocrates' diploma never threw him into coma in his efforts to decipher what its classic diction said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when he was seeking practice&mdash;long ago&mdash;the simple fact is that the Latin tongue was common and was very far from dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He often growled, "Dad gum it!" when he felt the glossy summit of his head, which was as bald as any shiny billiard ball&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But old Hip had to endure it, for he knew he couldn't cure it, and that once his hair was falling, why, he had to let it fall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He was written up by Plato (who was quite a hot potato when it came to mental effort, for you know he reasoned well);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plato praised his diagnosis, called him healing's patient Moses, and though facts were hard to gather, found a goodly lot to tell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hippocrates had knowledge, though he didn't go to college; he could speak of all diseases that he knew, in Latin terms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Still, 'twas only second nature to affect that nomenclature), but he never even thought of, much less heard of, any germs.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Streptococcus or bacillus such as get in us and kill us to Hippocrates were always undiscovered
and unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grim appendicitis which today is sure to
fright us, was by Dr. Hip considered but a
stomach-achic groan.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Were he living at this moment, would the world
be in a foment? Would physicians of the
present take him out to see the town?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From New Jersey clear to Joppa not a one would
call him "Papa," and his theories and treatments
would be greeted with a frown.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We must say that he was clever, and that in one
way, however, he resembled all the others who
are treating human ills&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was constantly complaining that in spite of all
his training he could never cure his patients
of the trait of dodging bills.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You see (again we make the point that scientific minds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discover facts which any brain that's common never finds),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see, when Newton felt the jolt, his science did not stop&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He simply meditated on "What made the apple drop?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while in cogitation deep beneath the tree he lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mused: "It's odd that apples never drop the other way."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once more: If you or I had been beneath the apple tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We might have howled: "Who was it threw that apple and hit me?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To finish this, however, with becoming gravity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll state that Newton lingered there beneath the apple tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With logarithmic tables he discovered that the speed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At which the apple fell was based on whence it fell&mdash;indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had it dropped from the moon, we'll say, it would have grown so hot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it would have been melted up before to earth it got.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">Yet he smiled across at wifey grim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she tried her hand at pastry was the only time he spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And of course he had to make a break&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas perhaps the first appearance of the ever-lasting joke<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On the pies that mother used to make.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Poor Socrates! He never even ducked his head or dodged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But merely rubbed the spot whereon the flying platter lodged,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then he murmured: "Xanty, dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You have made a problem clear"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he went to get the swelling on his cranium massaged.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Xantippe wouldn't let him smoke at all about the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And she wouldn't let him take a drink.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never learned the value of a two-spot or an ace&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For 'most all that he could do was think.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus you see that though Xantippe has been fiercly criticized,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Yet she really made her husband's fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For 'twas while she bossed him sorely that the great man analyzed<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All the subjects that have made his name.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Xantippe made him famous; but for her the man had been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgotten like the others of the time that he lived in.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Oh, my darling, such a help!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He most gratefully would yelp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she gave him an impression with a busy rolling-pin.<br /></span>

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
